This website was Built with React.js using json-server on the backend to Get, Post, Updat and Delete data and show it on Client side as well in the form of list.
You may take a look at the the webiste here: https://sheharayrgroceriesitems.netlify.app/
Right now the website will not fetch any data as the backend is of json-server which can be run locally.
Thank you so much for visting my repository :)
